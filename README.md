For all those geek developers around 🤓, we use the `MERN` stack for our application.
For those who don't know what `MERN` is, it's a short-form of:
* `MySQL` or in our case, `PostgreSQL` which is just an extension of `MySQL`
* `Express` which is a framework for `NodeJS` as our backend technology
* `React Native` on which our app runs
* The jack of all trades, `NodeJS` on which the entire application including our backend operates.
